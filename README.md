As of current, the only way to properly run this script ( for the forseeable future [due to the manifest v3 update], is to use code injector and jQuery 2.1.x on firefox, which will contnue to  support legacy JS code injectors, which this script, in its current form, needs to run.

I'll work to make this plug and play on tampermonkey for firefox, as a simple local file download.

Next step is to make the conversion executable for MACOS and WINDOWS which will spit out the .ics file.
